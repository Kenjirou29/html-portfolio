<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am <b>Atom C. Malinao</b>, a motivated and detail-oriented Computer
  Engineering graduate with a solid foundation in both software and hardware
  systems. My academic journey at Samar State University, where I earned my
  Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, has equipped me with robust skills
  in C/C++ programming, coding, designing, and testing software. These skills
  are complemented by my proficiency in MS Office and my ability to communicate
  effectively in English, Tagalog, and Waray.

  During my internship at PhilHealth Regional Office VIII, I gained practical
  experience in IT support and software development. I was responsible for
  evaluating computer equipment, conducting preventive maintenance, and
  providing technical support for hardware and software issues. I also
  implemented the 5S methodology in the ITMS office and stockroom to optimize
  efficiency and organization. My role required me to create detailed
  spreadsheets for inventory management, participate in market studies,
  troubleshoot printer repairs, and maintain accurate inventory records.

  One of my notable achievements includes developing the Program Outcome
  Assessment and Record Management System (POARMS) for the College of
  Engineering at Samar State University. As a back-end developer for this
  project, I honed my skills in coding, system design, and software testing.
  Additionally, I led my team to victory at the 2023 CpE Challenge: Robothon
  Competition and successfully passed the Civil Service Commission Career
  Service Examination.

  I am passionate about continuously expanding my knowledge and staying
  up-to-date with the latest industry trends. My excellent time management and
  critical thinking skills enable me to meet project deadlines and deliver
  high-quality results. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and
  collaborate with professionals in the field. In my free time, I enjoy learning
  new programming languages and exploring advancements in technology.
